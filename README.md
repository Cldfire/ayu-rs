Home to CSS based on the ST3 theme [ayu](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu) for the purpose of beautifying various Rustlang websites. It currently supports the following:

* [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/)
* [rustbyexample](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
  * Note that rustbyexample natively provides the Ayu theme, but not for the Ace editor; the CSS in this repo fixes that
* [crates.io](https://crates.io/)
* [play.rust-lang.org](https://play.rust-lang.org/)
  * Make sure you select the `Chrome` theme in the editor in order to use this theme's editor look
* [play.integer32.com](https://play.integer32.com/)
  * Same as above
* [this-week-in-rust.org](https://this-week-in-rust.org/)

## Usage

* Install [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
* Click the "Install directly with Stylus" badge at the top of the README
